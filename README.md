# cash_register_count
This app helps count the amount of money in the cash register.

In the retail industry, employees working the cash registers are required to count the amount of money in their registers at the end of the working day. While working in such capacity, I was required to do this at the end of my shift, when the store closed. Because I found the task of adding and multiplying the different denominations somewhat lengthy and repetitive, I created this small app to help in that effort.

Basically, all one has to do is to enter the quantity of each denomination in the corresponding textfield (or EditText), and the additions and multiplications are done automatically.

The app is comprised of several java and xml files.
There are many options I still want to add to this app; it's just a matter of finding the time to work on it.

I have influded four files here.
